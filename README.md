# pypdf_table_extraction (DEPRECATED)

**This project is deprecated and no longer actively maintained.**

Please use [camelot-py](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot) instead.

Camelot-py is the actively maintained successor to this library and provides robust PDF table extraction capabilities.

## Installation

```bash
pip install camelot-py
```

**pypdf_table_extraction** Formerly known as [Camelot](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot) is a Python library that can help you extract tables from PDFs!

---

**Here's how you can extract tables from PDFs.**
You can check out the quickstart notebook. [![image](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/py-pdf/pypdf_table_extraction/blob/main/examples/pypdf_table_extraction_quick_start_notebook.ipynb)

Or follow the example below.
You can check out the PDF used in this example [here](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf_table_extraction/blob/main/docs/_static/pdf/foo.pdf).

```python3
>>> import pypdf_table_extraction
>>> tables = pypdf_table_extraction.read_pdf('foo.pdf')
>>> tables
<TableList n=1>
>>> tables.export('foo.csv', f='csv', compress=True) # json, excel, html, markdown, sqlite
>>> tables[0]
<Table shape=(7, 7)>
>>> tables[0].parsing_report
{
    'accuracy': 99.02,
    'whitespace': 12.24,
    'order': 1,
    'page': 1
}
>>> tables[0].to_csv('foo.csv') # to_json, to_excel, to_html, to_markdown, to_sqlite
>>> tables[0].df # get a pandas DataFrame!
```

pypdf_table_extraction also comes packaged with a [command-line interface](https://pypdf-table-extraction.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/cli.html)!

Refer to the [QuickStart Guide](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf_table_extraction/blob/main/docs/user/quickstart.rst#quickstart) to quickly get started with pypdf_table_extraction, extract tables from PDFs and explore some basic options.

**Tip:** Visit the `parser-comparison-notebook` to get an overview of all the packed parsers and their features.

**Note:** pypdf_table_extraction only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. (As Tabula [explains](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula#why-tabula), "If you can click and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based".)

You can check out some frequently asked questions [here](https://pypdf-table-extraction.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/faq.html).

## Why pypdf_table_extraction?

- **Configurability**: pypdf_table_extraction gives you control over the table extraction process with [tweakable settings](https://pypdf-table-extraction.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced.html).
- **Metrics**: You can discard bad tables based on metrics like accuracy and whitespace, without having to manually look at each table.
- **Output**: Each table is extracted into a **pandas DataFrame**, which seamlessly integrates into [ETL and data analysis workflows](https://gist.github.com/vinayak-mehta/e5949f7c2410a0e12f25d3682dc9e873). You can also export tables to multiple formats, which include CSV, JSON, Excel, HTML, Markdown, and Sqlite.
